Hi please create a web app based on the following spec:1.User will input medical device name, model number and related information 2. You will create a prompt to search FDA related information on web pages and create a comprehensive summary of the results in markdown in 2000~3000 words with 3 tables. 3. You will create  a wow interactive web page containing previous results and user can choose light/dark themes, English/Traditional Chinese, 20 styles based on flowers (user can use Jackslot to choose style). Please adding 3 additional FUN visual features in the interactive webpage (created by you). Ending with 20 comprehensive follow up question.

Hi please create a agentic ai system based on the sample code. Please let user to choose light/dark themes, English/Traditional Chinese, 20 styles based on flowers (user can use Jackslot to choose style) and input api key on webpage if not get from the environment. Don’t show api key if get from the environment. 

super, please don't modify codes and create a comprehensive technical specification in markdown in 2000~3000 words in traditional chinese.


Super, please create 3 mock datasets in defaultdataset.json based on the design. Please improve the design by loading the default datasets (defaultdataset.json) at start. User can select case to load or download application dataset (JSON or csv).

HI please think deeper (ultra think) and iterate until get excellent results. Ending with 20 comprehensive follow up questions.





You will be creating a prompt that can be used in OPAL/Google to generate an application based on sample code. Your task is to analyze the provided sample code, understand its structure and functionality, then incorporate the user's description to create an improved prompt for app generation.

Here is the sample code to analyze:

<sample_code>
{{SAMPLE_CODE}}
</sample_code>

Here is the user's description of the app they want to create or improve:

<app_description>
{{APP_DESCRIPTION}}
</app_description>

Your task is to create a comprehensive prompt that can be used to generate an application. Follow these steps:

First, in <scratchpad> tags, analyze the sample code and plan your prompt:
- Identify the key components, features, and architecture of the sample code
- Note the technologies, libraries, and frameworks used (e.g., Streamlit, OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic APIs)
- Identify the main functionalities (e.g., PDF processing, LLM integration, UI components, agent systems)
- Consider how the user's description relates to or differs from the sample code
- Determine what aspects should be preserved, modified, or enhanced based on the user's description
- Plan the structure of your prompt to ensure it's clear and actionable

Then, create a detailed prompt for OPAL/Google that includes:

1. **Context and Purpose**: Explain what the application should do, incorporating insights from both the sample code and the user's description

2. **Technical Requirements**: Specify the technologies, frameworks, and libraries to use (based on what you identified in the sample code)

3. **Core Features**: List the main features and functionalities the app should have, enhanced or modified according to the user's description

4. **Architecture and Structure**: Describe how the application should be organized (e.g., session state management, page structure, component organization)

5. **UI/UX Requirements**: Specify the user interface elements, styling approach, and user experience considerations

6. **Integration Points**: Detail any API integrations, external services, or data processing pipelines needed

7. **Specific Improvements**: Based on the user's description, highlight specific enhancements or modifications to make to the design

8. **Code Organization**: Suggest how the code should be structured (functions, classes, modules)

Write your complete prompt inside <prompt> tags. The prompt should be detailed enough that a developer or AI system could use it to generate a functional application. Make sure to:
- Be specific about technical implementation details
- Include examples where helpful
- Specify input/output formats
- Mention error handling and edge cases
- Consider scalability and maintainability

Your final output should contain only the <prompt> section with the complete, ready-to-use prompt for app generation. Do not include the scratchpad in your final output.
